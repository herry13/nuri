State Trajectory Constraints

1) global constraint = p1
remove all actions that falsifies p1

2) global constraint = p1 OR p2 OR p3
foreach action a
- keep a if makes true p1, p2, or p3 (pre-post)
- keep a if it has p1, p2, or p3 as precondition and doesn't falsify (prevail)
- if a falsify p1, then create two copies a1 & a2
then add p2 as precondition of a1, add p3 as precondition of a2
then remove a

3) global constraint = p1 -> p2 = (not p1) OR p2
go to step #2

4) global constraint = complex formula
use Fast-Downward translation technique in his paper

Issues
1) immediate effect (with deadline) after another effect occurs
"if a port of firewall is not used, it should be closed immediately"

(sometime-after (not (used port80)) (within 1 (closed port80)))

2) counting constraint (?)
"for anytime, there must be two running servers"
