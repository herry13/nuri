27-02-2013 -- 0.3.2
+ Add a new module "rackspace" that manages Rackspace Compute V2 (Next-Gen)

25-02-2013 -- 0.3.1
+ Fix a bug on the planner when a variable's initial value equals <sfp::unknown>.
  This is fixed by adding <sfp::unknown> to domain of all non-static variables.

18-02-2013 -- 0.3.1
+ send a BSig-goal to a node that supports the goal
+ the BSig-goal of uncreated VM will be sent to cloud-proxy, which will be
  sent to Nuri client-agent after the VM has been created
+ activate BSig model of a new-created VM after it received the BSig model
+ a node with "null" address means that it is a VM but not yet created
+ if a Nuri client-agent cannot be contacted, then all variables of that agent
  have values "<sfp::unknown>"
+ a variable has value "<sfp::undefined>" iff the node has been created,
  the Nuri client-agent can be contacted, and the variable is not exist in
  that node
+ BSig-goal is a collection of pairs of variable-value, where variable's final
  value is either not same with the initial state, or supported by an operator
  in the workflow

11-02-2013 -- 0.3.0a
+ add the cloud-proxy node as "trusted" node -- inside "create_vm"
+ enable system-information propagation between children nodes
+ planner optimization
  + run 1st with CG|CEA|FF to generate highly likely possible actions
  + remove actions which are not selected by previous step
  + run LMCUT with selected actions to get sub-optimal workflow

10-02-2013 -- 0.3.0a
+ enable machine's reference in members of Apachelb

08-02-2013 -- 0.3.0
+ enable cloud-proxy as a component, but right now only support HP-Cloud
+ cloud-proxy is not integrated anymore with master-node
+ new configuration in nuri.sfp: "virtual_machine" (boolean)
  represents whether a node is a virtual machine or not; if it is, then use VM instead of Machine class
+ update "get_system_information" method in master.rb to adopt cloud-proxy
+ class VM is a subclass of class Machine in both SFP and Ruby codes

09-01-2013 -- 0.2.1
+ set time limit for the solver (default 5mins) -- it can be set by specifying "solver_timeout"
  in "nuri.sfp"
+ prioritise repairing local-flaws than remote-flaws
+ rename method "get_self_state" => "update_state" in resource.rb and all modules' ruby files

07-01-2013 -- 0.2.1
+ new module: cloud (only handle HPCloud)
+ create/delete Virtual Machine (VM)
+ allow "parent" to be used in reference of constraint or mutation
+ obligation to provide manifest file (main.mf) for non-abstract module
+ any module without manifest file is an abstract module
  (it will not loaded by Nuri when aggregating current state)

02-01-2013 -- 0.2.0
+ fix bugs in 'lib/nuri/sfp/sas.rb' -- in remove_not_constraint method
+ enable multiple statements in conditional constraint
+ allow administrator to check BSig status
+ push trusted nodes from master to client
+ restrict request only from trusted nodes in client
+ allow client to expose its active BSig model

27-12-2012 -- 0.2.0 (beta1)
+ fix bugs on BSig reminder -- send start BSig request through localhost
+ provide HTTP PUT /bsig/start -- to accept request starting BSig executor
+ fix partial-order workflow generator (use TO2PO algorithm in Ambite & Knoblock,
  Planning by Rewriting (2001) to replace Veloso et.al.'s algorithm(1990))
+ provide new console command: console start-bsig
+ fix bugs on repairing local-flaws: need to check post-conditions of every
  operator execution with the real current state
+ bin/nuri.rb can be called from any directory

24-12-2012 -- 0.2.0 (beta)
+ enable synchronous BSig execution (replacing the asynchronous version)
+ redirect webrick logs (all levels) to "log/http.log"

23-12-2012
+ enable BSig executor to send request to itself (localhost) for satisfying an operator's precondition
+ fix bugs on start/stop nuri client

21-12-2012 -- 0.2.0 (alpha)
+ enable distributed execution, but only tested on a system with 3 nodes

19-12-2012 -- 0.1.4
+ from master node, sending BSig model to each client nodes
+ on client node, saving the BSig model

18-12-2012 -- 0.1.3
+ enable partial-order workflow
+ generate BSig model
+ modify CLI parameters in 'bin/nuri.rb'
  -c => console
  -p => planner

12-12-2012 -- 0.1.2
+ replace mongrel with WEBrick
+ disable secure connection due to immature implementations (buggy)

18-11-2012 -- 0.1.1
+ implement modules to manage TikiWiki; separated into two modules:
	- Tikiweb -- managing the frontend: installing PHP files, set PHP config
	- Tikidb -- managing the backend: executing SQL to create the database, grant/revoke permissions

12-11-2012
+ implement module "Apachelb" -- Apache Load Balancer
+ allow Set as argument of procedure

06-11-2012
+ first release
+ available modules
	- Apache
	- Mysql
